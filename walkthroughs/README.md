# Walkthroughs

This folder contains all walkthrough documents for the Next.js E-commerce project.

## Purpose
Walkthroughs are created after completing implementation and verification to document:
- What changes were made
- What was tested and how
- Validation results and proof of work
- Screenshots and recordings of UI changes
- Any issues encountered and how they were resolved

## Structure
Each walkthrough follows this format:
1. **Summary** - Overview of what was accomplished
2. **Changes Made** - Detailed list of modifications
3. **Testing Performed** - What was tested and results
4. **Visual Proof** - Screenshots, recordings, or demos
5. **Next Steps** - Any follow-up work or recommendations

## Naming Convention
Files are named based on the completed feature or task:
- `feature-name-walkthrough.md`
- `bugfix-description-walkthrough.md`
- `refactor-component-walkthrough.md`

## Usage
1. Walkthroughs are created after implementation is complete
2. They serve as proof of work and documentation
3. Include visual evidence (screenshots/videos) when applicable
4. Help track what has been delivered and verified

## Relationship to Implementation Plans
- **Implementation Plan** = What we WILL do (before work starts)
- **Walkthrough** = What we DID do (after work completes)
