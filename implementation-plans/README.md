# Implementation Plans

This folder contains all implementation plan documents for the Next.js E-commerce project.

## Purpose
Implementation plans are created during the PLANNING phase to document:
- Technical approach and design decisions
- Proposed changes grouped by component
- Files to be modified, created, or deleted
- Verification and testing strategy

## Structure
Each implementation plan follows this format:
1. **Goal Description** - Problem statement and objectives
2. **User Review Required** - Critical decisions and breaking changes
3. **Proposed Changes** - Detailed file-by-file changes
4. **Verification Plan** - Testing and validation approach

## Naming Convention
Files are named based on the feature or task:
- `feature-name-implementation.md`
- `bugfix-description-implementation.md`
- `refactor-component-implementation.md`

## Usage
1. Plans are created before starting implementation
2. User reviews and approves the plan
3. Changes are implemented according to the approved plan
4. Verification is performed as documented
